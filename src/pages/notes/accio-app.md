# Accio App

Wish to make [[Second Brain]] App on [[React Native]] [[Expo]] & for [[Mac OS]]

RN for Mac OS – https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started
Auth by [[Github]] – https://docs.expo.io/guides/authentication/#github

## Process

First we need make bare Expo app (not working with RN for Mac OS yet)

```bash

# If you don't have expo-cli yet, get it
npm i -g expo-cli
# If you don't have react-native-cli yet, get it
npm i -g react-native-cli
# This is a shortcut to skip the UI for picking the template
expo init --template bare-minimum

```

or Install RN for Mac OS

```bash

# Remember to call react-native init from the place you want your project directory to live.
npx react-native init <projectName> --version 0.61.5

# Install the React Native for macOS packages.
npx react-native-macos-init

# Update the CocoaPods versions
npx pod-install

#Without using Xcode: In your React Native macOS project directory, run:
npx react-native run-macos

# or
xed -b macos && yarn start:macos

```
