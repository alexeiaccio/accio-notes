## First step

This notes was built with the Brain [[Gatsby Theme]]. You can find the source and npm package installation instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain).

## Second step

I implemented [[Brain]] with [[Next.js]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Gatsby Theme]: gatsby-theme "Gatsby Theme"
[Brain]: brain "Brain"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
