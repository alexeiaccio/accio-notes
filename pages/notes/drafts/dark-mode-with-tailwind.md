[[Dark Mode]] with [[Tailwind]] [[CSS]]

First you'll need to add a custom media query to your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        dark: { raw: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)' }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Then you may use the breakpoint in your HTML.

```js
<main class="bg-white dark:bg-black"></main>
```
